/**
 * @file Firebase Security Rules for Definition Detective.
 *
 * @description This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user profiles and game sessions,
 *              while allowing public read access to leaderboard entries with authenticated-user-only writes.
 *
 * @dataStructure
 *  - /userProfiles/{userId}: Stores user profile data, accessible only to the user.
 *  - /userProfiles/{userId}/gameSessions/{gameSessionId}: Stores game session data, accessible only to the owning user.
 *  - /leaderboardEntries/{leaderboardEntryId}: Stores leaderboard entries, publicly readable, writable only by authenticated users.
 *
 * @keySecurityDecisions
 *  - User profiles and game sessions are strictly owned by the user identified in the path.
 *  - Listing of user profiles is disallowed to prevent unauthorized data access.
 *  - Leaderboard entries are publicly readable, but only authenticated users can create, update, or delete entries.
 *  - Increment operations in update requests are not specifically validated.
