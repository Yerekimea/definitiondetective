# **App Name**: Definition Detective

- Procedural Level Generation: Endlessly generate unique word puzzles using a procedural algorithm for infinite gameplay. The seed for level generation is derived from the game difficulty
- Definition Scrambler: Scramble the definitions of multiple words to present the player with a mixed-up challenge.
- Smart Word Hints: The word hint will show a few letters of the solution. Hints should use LLM reasoning (a tool) to determine the most helpful letter set to display based on what wrong letters have already been tried. The AI Model used is DeepSeek.
